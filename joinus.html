<h4>PhD and honours students:</h4>
<p>
  I am always looking for highly motivated students to join my group. I can supervise students through both the School of Mathematics and Statistics or through the applied medical science program (AMED) at The Westmead Institute for Medical Research.
  I can help you construct a project that falls anywhere on the spectrum of applying computational techniques to biological questions using high-throughput technologies to the development of the analytic tools need to do this.
  I have collaborators that work in cancer, neurology and immunology who perform experiments using RNA-Seq, nanostring, mass spectrometry, flow cytometry and imaging mass cytometry and have various potential projects associated with these. </p>
<p> Current or prospective students can email me (ellis.patrick@sydney.edu.au) to find out more. </p>
