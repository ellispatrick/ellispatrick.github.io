	abstract = {There is accumulating evidence that patients with functional neurological symptom disorder (FND) show activation of multiple components of the stress system-the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nervous system, and brain regions involved in arousal- and emotion-processing. This study aims to examine whether the immune-inflammatory component of the stress system is also activated. C-reactive protein (CRP) blood titre levels were measured in 79 children and adolescents with FND. CRP values ≥ 2 mg/L suggest low-grade inflammation. CRP values {\textgreater} 10 mg/L suggest a disease process. Sixty-six percent of subjects (n = 52) had CRP titres ≥ 2 mg/L. The upward shift in the distribution of CRP levels suggested low-grade inflammation (median CRP concentration was 4.60 mg/L, with 75th and 90th percentiles of 6.1 and 10.3 mg/L, respectively). Elevated CRP titres were not explained by sex, pubertal status, BMI, or medical factors. Confounder analyses suggested that history of maltreatment (χ2 = 2.802, df = 1, p = 0.094, φ = 0.190; β = 2.823, p = 0.04) and a diagnosis of anxiety (χ2 = 2.731, df = 1, p = 0.098, φ = 0.187; β = 4.520, p = 0.061) contributed to elevated CRP levels. Future research will need to identify the origins and locations of immune cell activation and the pathways and systems contributing to their activation and modulation. Because functional activity in neurons and glial cells-the brain's innate effector immune cells-is tightly coupled, our finding of elevated CRP titres suggests activation of the immune-inflammatory component of the brain's stress system. A more direct examination of inflammation-related molecules in the brain will help clarify the role of immune-inflammatory processes in FND.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of the innate immune system in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neurodegenerative disease susceptibility has recently been highlighted in genetic studies. However, we do not know whether risk for inflammatory disease predisposes unaffected individuals to late-life cognitive deficits or AD-related neuropathology. We investigated whether genetic risk scores for seven immune diseases and central nervous system traits were related to cognitive decline (nmax = 1601), classical AD neuropathology (nmax = 985), or microglial density (nmax = 184).
METHODS: Longitudinal cognitive decline, postmortem amyloid and tau neuropathology, microglial density, and gene module expression from bulk brain tissue were all measured in participants from two large cohorts (the Rush Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project; ROS/MAP) of elderly subjects (mean age at entry 78 +/- 8.7 years). We analyzed data primarily using robust regression methods. Neuropathologists were blind to clinical data.
RESULTS: The AD genetic risk scores, including and excluding APOE effects, were strongly associated with cognitive decline in all domains (min Puncor = 3.2 × 10- 29). Multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia risk did not influence cognitive decline in older age, but the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk score alone was significantly associated with microglial density after correction (t146 = - 3.88, Puncor = 1.6 × 10- 4). Post-hoc tests found significant effects of the RA genetic risk score in multiple regions and stages of microglial activation (min Puncor = 1.5 × 10- 6). However, these associations were driven by only one or two variants, rather than cumulative polygenicity. Further, individual MS (Pone-sided {\textless} 8.4 × 10- 4) and RA (Pone-sided = 3 × 10- 4) variants associated with higher microglial density were also associated with increased expression of brain immune gene modules.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that global risk of inflammatory disease does not strongly influence aging-related cognitive decline but that susceptibility variants that influence peripheral immune function also alter microglial density and immune gene expression in the aging brain, opening a new perspective on the control of microglial and immune responses within the central nervous system. Further study on the molecular mechanisms of peripheral immune disease risk influencing glial cell activation will be required to identify key regulators of these pathways.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Human females have a unique duration of post-reproductive longevity, during which sex-specific mechanisms ma influence later-life mechanisms of neuronal resilience and vulnerability. The maintenance of energy metabolism, through the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) apparatus, is essential for brain health. Given the known association between reproductive period (years from menarche to menopause) and cognitive aging, we examined the hypothesis that cumulative estrogen exposure across the lifetime may be associated with differential methylation of genes in the OXPHOS pathway.
METHODS: Using DNA methylation patterns in the post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 426 women prospectively followed until death in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, we examined the relationship between reproductive period (subtracting age at menarche from age at menopause) and DNA methylation of a published set of autosomal OXPHOS genes previously implicated in stroke susceptibility. We then performed an unsupervised analysis of methylation levels across the Hallmark pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database.
RESULTS: We observed a strong association between reproductive period and DNA methylation status across OXPHOS CpGs. We replicated this association between reproductive period and DNA methylation in a much larger set of OXPHOS genes in our unsupervised analysis. Here, reproductive period also showed associations with methylation in genes related to E2F, MYC and MTORC1 signaling, fatty acid metabolism and DNA repair.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence from both a supervised and unsupervised analyses, that lifetime cumulative endogenous steroid exposures may play a role in maintenance of post-menopausal cellular balance, including in brain tissue.},

Here, we establish the set of genes that is preferentially expressed by microglia in the aged human brain. This HuMi\_Aged gene set captures a unique phenotype, which we confirm at the protein level. Furthermore, we find this gene set to be enriched in susceptibility genes for Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, to be increased with advancing age, and to be reduced by the protective APOEε2 haplotype.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We characterised the clinical course, treatment and outcomes in 59 patients with relapsing myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated demyelination.
METHODS: We evaluated clinical phenotypes, annualised relapse rates (ARR) prior and on immunotherapy and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), in 218 demyelinating episodes from 33 paediatric and 26 adult patients.
RESULTS: The most common initial presentation in the cohort was optic neuritis (ON) in 54\% (bilateral (BON) 32\%, unilateral (UON) 22\%), followed by acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (20\%), which occurred exclusively in children. ON was the dominant phenotype (UON 35\%, BON 19\%) of all clinical episodes. 109/226 (48\%) MRIs had no brain lesions. Patients were steroid responsive, but 70\% of episodes treated with oral prednisone relapsed, particularly at doses {\textless}10 mg daily or within 2 months of cessation. Immunotherapy, including maintenance prednisone (P=0.0004), intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab and mycophenolate, all reduced median ARRs on-treatment. Treatment failure rates were lower in patients on maintenance steroids (5\%) compared with non-steroidal maintenance immunotherapy (38\%) (P=0.016). 58\% of patients experienced residual disability (average follow-up 61 months, visual loss in 24\%). Patients with ON were less likely to have sustained disability defined by a final EDSS of ≥2 (OR 0.15, P=0.032), while those who had any myelitis were more likely to have sustained residual deficits (OR 3.56, P=0.077).
CONCLUSION: Relapsing MOG antibody-associated demyelination is strongly associated with ON across all age groups and ADEM in children. Patients are highly responsive to steroids, but vulnerable to relapse on steroid reduction and cessation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given multiple studies of brain microRNA (miRNA) in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) with few consistent results and the heterogeneity of this disease, the objective of this study was to explore their mechanism by evaluating their relation to different elements of Alzheimer's disease pathology, confounding factors and mRNA expression data from the same subjects in the same brain region.
METHODS: We report analyses of expression profiling of miRNA (n = 700 subjects) and lincRNA (n = 540 subjects) from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals participating in two longitudinal cohort studies of aging.
RESULTS: We confirm the association of two well-established miRNA (miR-132, miR-129) with pathologic AD in our dataset and then further characterize this association in terms of its component neuritic β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle pathologies. Additionally, we identify one new miRNA (miR-99) and four lincRNA that are associated with these traits. Many other previously reported associations of microRNA with AD are associated with the confounders quantified in our longitudinal cohort. Finally, by performing analyses integrating both miRNA and RNA sequence data from the same individuals (525 samples), we characterize the impact of AD associated miRNA on human brain expression: we show that the effects of miR-132 and miR-129-5b converge on certain genes such as EP300 and find a role for miR200 and its target genes in AD using an integrated miRNA/mRNA analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, miRNAs play a modest role in human AD, but we observe robust evidence that a small number of miRNAs are responsible for specific alterations in the cortical transcriptome that are associated with AD.},

This intrinsic heterogeneity poses one of the central challenges to predicting patient clinical outcome and the personalization of treatments. Despite progress in some individual tumor types, it is not yet possible to prospectively, accurately classify patients by expected survival. One hypothesis proposed to explain this is that the prognostic classifiers developed to date are insufficiently sensitive and specific; however it is also possible that patients are not equally easy to classify by any given biomarker. We demonstrate in a cohort of 45 AJCC stage III melanoma patients that clinico-pathologic biomarkers can identify those patients that are most likely to be misclassified by a molecular biomarker. The process of modelling the classifiability of patients was then replicated in a cohort of 49 stage II breast cancer patients and 53 stage III colon cancer patients. A multi-step procedure incorporating this information not only improved classification accuracy but also indicated the specific clinical attributes that had made classification problematic in each cohort. These findings show that, even when cohorts are of moderate size, including features that explain the patient-specific performance of a prognostic biomarker in a classification framework can improve the modelling and estimation of survival.},

Traditional experimental design often compares a single treatment with a control, whereas increasingly more experiments are designed to compare multiple treatments with respect to a control. To this end, the development of bioinformatic tools that can integrate multiple treatments and visualise kinases and substrates under combinatorial perturbations is vital for dissecting concordant and/or independent effects of each treatment. Here, we propose a hypothesis driven kinase perturbation analysis (KinasePA) to annotate and visualise kinases and their substrates that are perturbed by various combinatorial effects of treatments in phosphoproteomics experiments. We demonstrate the utility of KinasePA through its application to two large-scale phosphoproteomics datasets and show its effectiveness in dissecting kinases and substrates within signalling pathways driven by unique combinations of cellular stimuli and inhibitors. We implemented and incorporated KinasePA as part of the "directPA" R package available from the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN). Furthermore, KinasePA also has an interactive web interface that can be readily applied to annotate user provided phosphoproteomics data (http://kinasepa.pengyiyang.org).},

This study used tongue twisters to test predictions of the two different models of word form encoding. Tongue twisters were constructed from 5 sets of characters that rotated pairs of initial segments or pairs of tones, or both, across format (ABAB, ABBA), and across position of the characters in four-character tongue twister strings. Fifty two native Mandarin Chinese speakers read aloud 120 tongue twisters, repeating each one six times in a row. They made a total of 3503 (2.34\%) segment errors and 1372 (.92\%) tone errors. Segment errors occurred on the onsets of the first and third characters in the ABBA but not ABAB segment-alternating tongue twisters, and on the onsets of the second and fourth characters of the tone-alternating tongue twisters. Tone errors were highest on the third and fourth characters in the tone-alternating tongue twisters. The pattern of tone errors is consistent with the claim that tone is associated to a metrical frame prior to segment encoding, while the format by position interaction found for the segment-alternating tongue twisters suggest articulatory gestures oscillate in segment production as proposed by gestural phonology.},

RESULTS: We propose a supervised framework, pMim, built upon concepts of significance combination, for jointly ranking regulatory micro-RNA and their potential functional impacts with respect to a condition of interest. Here, pMim directly tests if a micro-RNA is differentially expressed and if its predicted targets, which lie in a common biological pathway, have changed in the opposite direction. We leverage the information within existing micro-RNA target and pathway databases to stabilize the estimation and annotation of micro-RNA regulation making our approach suitable for datasets with small sample sizes. In addition to outputting meaningful and interpretable results, we demonstrate in a variety of datasets that the micro-RNA identified by pMim, in comparison to simpler existing approaches, are also more concordant with what is described in the literature.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: This framework is implemented as an R function, pMim, in the package sydSeq available from http://www.ellispatrick.com/r-packages.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq has the potential to answer many diverse and interesting questions about the inner workings of cells. Estimating changes in the overall transcription of a gene is not straightforward. Changes in overall gene transcription can easily be confounded with changes in exon usage which alter the lengths of transcripts produced by a gene. Measuring the expression of constitutive exons--xons which are consistently conserved after splicing--ffers an unbiased estimation of the overall transcription of a gene.
RESULTS: We propose a clustering-based method, exClust, for estimating the exons that are consistently conserved after splicing in a given data set. These are considered as the exons which are "constitutive" in this data. The method utilises information from both annotation and the dataset of interest. The method is implemented in an openly available R function package, sydSeq.
CONCLUSION: When used on two real datasets exClust includes more than three times as many reads as the standard UI method, and improves concordance with qRT-PCR data. When compared to other methods, our method is shown to produce robust estimates of overall gene transcription.},

	abstract = {The IFNL3 genotype predicts the clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV), spontaneously and with interferon (IFN)-based therapy. The responder genotype is associated with lower expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in liver biopsies from chronic hepatitis C patients. However, ISGs represent many interacting molecular pathways, and we hypothesised that the IFNL3 genotype may produce a characteristic pattern of ISG expression explaining the effect of genotype on viral clearance. For the first time, we identified an association between a cluster of ISGs, the metallothioneins (MTs) and IFNL3 genotype. Importantly, MTs were significantly upregulated (in contrast to most other ISGs) in HCV-infected liver biopsies of rs8099917 responders. An association between lower fibrosis scores and higher MT levels was demonstrated underlying clinical relevance of this association. As expected, overall ISGs were significantly downregulated in biopsies from subjects with the IFNL3 rs8099917 responder genotype (P=2.38 × 10(-7)). Peripheral blood analysis revealed paradoxical and not previously described findings with upregulation of ISGs seen in the responder genotype (P=1.00 × 10(-4)). The higher MT expression in responders may contribute to their improved viral clearance and MT-inducing agents may be useful adjuncts to therapy for HCV. Upregulation of immune cell ISGs in responders may also contribute to the IFNL3 genotype effect.},

	abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Muscle insulin resistance, one of the earliest defects associated with type 2 diabetes, involves changes in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt network. The relative contribution of obesity vs insulin resistance to perturbations in this pathway is poorly understood.
METHODS: We used phosphospecific antibodies against targets in the Akt signalling network to study insulin action in muscle from lean, overweight/obese and type 2 diabetic individuals before and during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp.
RESULTS: Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Thr309 and Ser474 was highly correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity. In contrast, impaired phosphorylation of Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160; also known as TBC1D4) was associated with adiposity, but not insulin sensitivity. Neither insulin sensitivity nor obesity was associated with defective insulin-dependent phosphorylation of forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor. In view of the resultant basal hyperinsulinaemia, we predicted that this selective response within the Akt pathway might lead to hyperactivation of those processes that were spared. Indeed, the expression of genes targeted by FOXO was downregulated in insulin-resistant individuals.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results highlight non-linearity in Akt signalling and suggest that: (1) the pathway from Akt to glucose transport is complex; and (2) pathways, particularly FOXO, that are not insulin-resistant, are likely to be hyperactivated in response to hyperinsulinaemia. This facet of Akt signalling may contribute to multiple features of the metabolic syndrome.},

	issn = {1471-2164},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-14-S1-S9},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cost of RNA-Seq has been decreasing over the last few years. Despite this, experiments with four or less biological replicates are still quite common. Estimating the variances of gene expression estimates becomes both a challenging and interesting problem in these situations of low replication. However, with the wealth of microarray and other publicly available gene expression data readily accessible on public repositories, these sources of information can be leveraged to make improvements in variance estimation.
RESULTS: We have proposed a novel approach called Tshrink+ for inferring differential gene expression through improved modelling of the gene-wise variances. Existing methods share information between genes of similar average expression by shrinking, or moderating, the gene-wise variances to a fitted common variance. We have been able to achieve improved estimation of the common variance by using gene-wise sample variances from external experiments, as well as gene length.
CONCLUSIONS: Using biological data we show that utilising additional external information can improve the modelling of the common variance and hence the calling of differentially expressed genes. These sources of additional information include gene length and gene-wise sample variances from other RNA-Seq and microarray datasets, of both related and seemingly unrelated tissue types. The results of this are promising, with our differential expression test, Tshrink+, performing favourably when compared to existing methods such as DESeq and edgeR when considering both gene ranking and sensitivity. These improved variance models could easily be implemented in both DESeq and edgeR and highlight the need for a database that offers a profile of gene variances over a range of tissue types and organisms.},

Associations with prognosis were replicated for miR-150-5p, miR-142-3p and miR-142-5p. Co-analysis of miRNA and mRNA uncovered a network associated with poor prognosis (PP) that paradoxically favoured expression of miRNAs opposing tumorigenesis. These miRNAs are likely part of an autoregulatory response to oncogenic drivers, rather than drivers themselves. Robust association of miR-150-5p and the miR-142 duplex with good prognosis and earlier stage metastatic melanoma supports their potential as biomarkers. miRNAs overexpressed in association with PP in an autoregulatory fashion will not be suitable therapeutic targets.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btt616},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: With the advancement of high-throughput techniques, large-scale profiling of biological systems with multiple experimental perturbations is becoming more prevalent. Pathway analysis incorporates prior biological knowledge to analyze genes/proteins in groups in a biological context. However, the hypotheses under investigation are often confined to a 1D space (i.e. up, down, either or mixed regulation). Here, we develop direction pathway analysis (DPA), which can be applied to test hypothesis in a high-dimensional space for identifying pathways that display distinct responses across multiple perturbations.
RESULTS: Our DPA approach allows for the identification of pathways that display distinct responses across multiple perturbations. To demonstrate the utility and effectiveness, we evaluated DPA under various simulated scenarios and applied it to study insulin action in adipocytes. A major action of insulin in adipocytes is to regulate the movement of proteins from the interior to the cell surface membrane. Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to study this process on a large-scale. The combined dataset comprises four separate treatments. By applying DPA, we identified that several insulin responsive pathways in the plasma membrane trafficking are only partially dependent on the insulin-regulated kinase Akt. We subsequently validated our findings through targeted analysis of key proteins from these pathways using immunoblotting and live cell microscopy. Our results demonstrate that DPA can be applied to dissect pathway networks testing diverse hypotheses and integrating multiple experimental perturbations.

Immunophenotyping of whole peripheral blood (WPB) by flow cytometry is a rapid method to obtain large amounts of data relating to the outcomes of different transplant treatments with limited patient impact. Healthy individuals and patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) enrolled in islet transplantation were recruited and WPB was collected. 46 fluorochrome-conjugated mouse-anti-human antibodies were used (43 of 46 antibodies were titrated). BD cytometer setup and tracking beads were used to characterize and adjust for cytometer performance. Antibody cocktails were pre-mixed {\textless}60 minutes before staining. Multicolour panels were designed based on fluorochrome brightness, antigen density, co-expression, and fluorochrome spillover into non-primary detectors in each panel on a 5 laser flow cytometer. WPB sample staining used 50–300 μl WPB for each panel and was performed within 2 hours of blood sample collection. Samples were acquired on a BD-LSRFortessa. The operating procedures, including specimen collection, antibody cocktails, staining protocol, flow-cytometer setup and data analysis, were standardized. The staining index of 43 antibodies and the spillover spreading matrix for each panel was calculated. The final concentrations for the 46 antibodies used was determined for staining of WPB samples. Absolute cell-count and 7 leukocyte profiling panels consisting of subsets and/or status of granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic, B, NK, and T cells including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and NKT were designed and established on a 5 laser BD-LSR Fortessa. 13 T1D patients, including 4 islet transplant recipients and 8 healthy controls, were evaluated.

Instead, here we propose extracting cellular embedding of environmental factors from gene expression data by using latent variable (LV) analysis and taking these LVs as environmental proxies in detecting gene-by-environment (GxE) interaction effects on gene expression, i.e., GxE expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Applying this approach to two largest brain eQTL datasets (n = 1,100), we show that LVs and GxE eQTLs in one dataset replicate well in the other dataset. Combining the two samples via meta-analysis, 895 GxE eQTLs are identified. On average, GxE effect explains an additional ∼4\% variation in expression of each gene that displays a GxE effect. Ten of these 52 genes are associated with cell-type-specific eQTLs, and the remaining genes are multi-functional. Furthermore, after substituting LVs with expression of transcription factors (TF), we found 91 TF-specific eQTLs, which demonstrates an important use of our brain GxE eQTLs.},

We used an ensemble of methods to prioritize 551 putative susceptibility genes that implicate multiple innate and adaptive pathways distributed across the cellular components of the immune system. Using expression profiles from purified human microglia, we observed enrichment for MS genes in these brain-resident immune cells, suggesting that these may have a role in targeting an autoimmune process to the central nervous system, although MS is most likely initially triggered by perturbation of peripheral immune responses.},

	abstract = {Over recent years, human autoantibodies targeting myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG Ab) have been associated with monophasic and relapsing central nervous system demyelination involving the optic nerves, spinal cord, and brain. While the clinical relevance of MOG Ab detection is becoming increasingly clear as therapeutic and prognostic differences from multiple sclerosis are acknowledged, an in-depth characterization of human MOG Ab is required to answer key challenges in patient diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Herein, we investigated the epitope, binding sensitivity, and affinity of MOG Ab in a cohort of 139 and 148 MOG antibody-seropositive children and adults (n = 287 patients at baseline, 130 longitudinal samples, and 22 cerebrospinal fluid samples). MOG extracellular domain was also immobilized to determine the affinity of MOG Ab. MOG Ab response was of immunoglobulin G1 isotype, and was of peripheral rather than intrathecal origin. High affinity MOG Ab were detected in 15\% paediatric and 18\% adult sera. More than 75\% of paediatric and adult MOG Ab targeted a dominant extracellular antigenic region around Proline42. MOG Ab titers fluctuated over the progression of disease, but affinity and reactivity to Proline42 remained stable. Adults with a relapsing course intrinsically presented with a reduced immunoreactivity to Proline42 and had a more diverse MOG Ab response, a feature that may be harnessed for predicting relapse. Higher titers of MOG Ab were observed in more severe phenotypes and during active disease, supporting the pathogenic role of MOG Ab. Loss of MOG Ab seropositivity was observed upon conformational changes to MOG, and this greatly impacted the sensitivity of the detection of relapsing disorders, largely considered as more severe. Careful consideration of the binding characteristics of autoantigens should be taken into account when detecting disease-relevant autoantibodies.},

We describe an approach, scHOT—single-cell higher-order testing—which provides a flexible and statistically robust framework for identifying changes in higher-order interactions among genes. scHOT can be applied for cells along a continuous trajectory or across space and accommodates various higher-order measurements including variability or correlation. We demonstrate the use of scHOT by studying coordinated changes in higher-order interactions during embryonic development of the mouse liver. Additionally, scHOT identifies subtle changes in gene–gene correlations across space using spatially resolved transcriptomics data from the mouse olfactory bulb. scHOT meaningfully adds to first-order differential expression testing and provides a framework for interrogating higher-order interactions using single-cell data.},

	abstract = {Objectives Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is known to have a significant impact on immune recovery post-allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Adoptive therapy with donor-derived or third-party virus-specific T cells (VST) can restore CMV immunity leading to clinical benefit in prevention and treatment of post-HSCT infection. We developed a mass cytometry approach to study natural immune recovery post-HSCT and assess the mechanisms underlying the clinical benefits observed in recipients of VST. Methods A mass cytometry panel of 38 antibodies was utilised for global immune assessment (72 canonical innate and adaptive immune subsets) in HSCT recipients undergoing natural post-HSCT recovery (n = 13) and HSCT recipients who received third-party donor-derived CMV-VST as salvage for unresponsive CMV reactivation (n = 8). Results Mass cytometry identified distinct immune signatures associated with CMV characterised by a predominance of innate cells (monocytes and NK) seen early and an adaptive signature with activated CD8+ T cells seen later. All CMV-VST recipients had failed standard antiviral pharmacotherapy as a criterion for trial involvement; 5/8 had failed to develop the adaptive immune signature by study enrolment despite significant CMV antigen exposure. Of these, VST administration resulted in development of the adaptive signature in association with CMV control in three patients. Failure to respond to CMV-VST in one patient was associated with persistent absence of the adaptive immune signature. Conclusion The clinical benefit of CMV-VST may be mediated by the recovery of an adaptive immune signature characterised by activated CD8+ T cells.},

They are the first cells of the immune system to encounter HIV and play a key role in transmission as they deliver the virus to CD4 T cells, which are the primary HIV target cell in which the virus undergoes replication. Most studies have investigated the role that epithelial MNPs play in HIV transmission but, as mucosal trauma and inflammation are strongly associated with HIV transmission, it is also important to examine the role that sub-epithelial MNPs play. Sub-epithelial MNPs are present in a diverse array of subsets which differ in their function and the pathogens they detect. Understanding how specific subsets interact with HIV and deliver the virus to CD4 T cells is therefore of key importance to vaccine and microbicide development. In this study we have shown that, after topical application, HIV can penetrate to interact with sub-epithelial resident myeloid cells in anogenital explants and defined the full array of MNP subsets that are present in all the human anogenital and colorectal sub-epithelial tissues that HIV may encounter during sexual transmission. In doing so we have identified two subsets that preferentially take up HIV, become infected and transmit the virus to CD4 T cells; CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$CD1c$^{\textrm{+}}$CD11c$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocyte-derived dendritic cells and langerin-expressing dendritic cells 2 (DC2).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Current approaches to mitigate autofluorescence in tissue are lab-based and involve either chemical treatment of sections or specialized instrumentation and software to ‘unmix’ autofluorescent signals. Importantly, these approaches are pre-emptive and there are currently no methods to deal with autofluorescence in acquired fluorescence microscopy images. To address this, we developed Autofluorescence Identifier (AFid). AFid identifies autofluorescent pixels as discrete objects in multi-channel images post acquisition. These objects can then be tagged for exclusion from downstream analysis. We validated AFid using images of FFPE human colorectal tissue stained for common immune markers. Further, we demonstrate its utility for image analysis where its implementation allows the accurate measurement of HIV-Dendritic Cell interactions in a colorectal explant model of HIV transmission.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Availability and implementation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}https://ellispatrick.github.io/AFid{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Contact{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}ellis.patrick@sydney.edu.au{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, using a transcriptional network map of the human frontal cortex, we identify five gene modules of co-expressed genes related to microglia and assess their role in the neuropathologic features of AD in 541 subjects from two cohort studies of brain aging. Two of these transcriptional programs – modules 113 and 114 – relate to the accumulation of β-amyloid, while module 5 relates to tau pathology. These modules are also detectable in the human brain9s epigenome, where we replicate these associations. In terms of tau, we propose that module 5, a marker of activated microglia, may lead to tau accumulation and subsequent cognitive decline. We validate our model further by showing that \textit{VASP}, a representative module 5 gene, encodes a protein that is upregulated in activated microglia in AD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
