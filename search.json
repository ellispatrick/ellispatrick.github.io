The framework is wrapped in a driver loop that reproducibly carries out a number of cross-validation schemes. Functions for differential mean, differential variability, and differential distribution are included. Additional functions may be developed by the user, by creating an interface to the framework.\n\n\nStrbenac D, Mann GJ, Ormerod JT, Yang JYH (2015). “ClassifyR: an R package for performance assessment of classification with applications to transcriptomics.” Bioinformatics, 31(11), 1851-1853."
