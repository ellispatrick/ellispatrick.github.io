Shila Ghazanfar has made her DCARS R package available on github, https://github.com/shazanfar/DCARS . DCARS is a flexible statistical approach which uses local weighted correlations to build a powerful and robust statistical test to identify significant variation in levels of concordance across a ranking of samples. This has the potential to discover biologically informative relationships between genes across a variable of interest, such as survival outcome.
