<h4>About Ellis Patrick:</h4>
 
<p>
I am a Senior Lecturer in the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-mathematics-and-statistics.html" target="_blank">School of Mathematics and Statistics</a> at The University of Sydney, a Faculty member at <a href="https://www.westmeadinstitute.org.au/" target="_blank">The Westmead Institute for Medical Research</a> and the Cluster Lead of Bioinformatics in the <a href="https://sydney.edu.au/science/data-science/" target="_blank">Sydney Precision Bioinformatics Centre</a>. My research interests lie at the interface of statistics and biomedical data science where I specialise in developing and implementing innovative bioinformatics tools to enhance our understanding and treatment of human diseases. I have cultivated an extensive collaborative network and apply my expertise in extracting meaning from cutting-edge high-dimensional molecular and cellular assays to enable research into infectious diseases, organ transplant, cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and cancer. The analytical challenges inherent in this disease-focused research necessitate the creation, evaluation, and sharing of advanced statistical methodology to support breakthrough discoveries. In my postdoctoral studies, I worked as a computational biologist with joint appointments at Brigham and Women's hospital, Harvard Medical School and The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard where I used my statistical background to investigate the molecular drivers of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and MS. 
My PhD thesis was on statistical methods for the analysis and interpretation of RNA-Seq data.
