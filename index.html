<p>About Ellis Patrick:</p>
  
<p>
I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Neurology at Brigham and Women’s hospital and hold affiliations with Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute. My current research interests revolve around using my statistical background to help further our understanding of the molecular components of Alzheimer’s disease and MS.  My statistical research interests include network analysis, the horizontal and vertical integration of large biomedical datasets, improving interpretation of multiple tests, normalization, feature selection and variance stabilization.<br>
