<h4>About Ellis Patrick:</h4>
 
<p>
I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women’s hospital, Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute. 
I work as a computational biologist in Philip De Jagers <a href="http://dejager_lab.bwh.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">lab</a> in the Department of Neurology where I use my statistical background to investigate the molecular components of Alzheimer’s disease and MS.  
Spending most of my time analysing large biomedical datasets, my research has relied on the subtlety of translating between biological and statistical concepts to form simple, suitable and targeted
statistical questions. 
My statistical research interests include developing methodology for pathway and network analysis, the horizontal and vertical integration of large datasets, improving interpretation of multiple tests, normalization,
feature selection and variance stabilization.
