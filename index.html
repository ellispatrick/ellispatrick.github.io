<h4>About Ellis Patrick:</h4>
 
<p>
I am a Senior Lecturer in the School of Mathematics and Statistics and a faculty member at The Westmead Institute for Medical Research.
My research interests center on the use and development of statistical methodology to analyse high-dimensional experiments and studies that measure the behaviour of thousands of molecules, cells, samples or subjects. 
Given this, I place a large value on the subtlety of translating between biological and statistical concepts to form suitable and targeted hypotheses.
In my postdoctoral studies, I worked as a computational biologist with joint appointments at Brigham and Women's hospital, Harvard Medical School and The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard where I used my statistical background to investigate the molecular drivers of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and MS. 
My PhD thesis was on statistical methods for the analysis and interpretation of RNA-Seq data.
