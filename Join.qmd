## PhD and honours students:  

  I am always looking for highly motivated students to join my group. I can supervise students through both the School of Mathematics and Statistics or through the applied medical science program (AMED) at The Westmead Institute for Medical Research. I can help you construct a project that falls anywhere on the spectrum of applying computational techniques to answer complex biomedical questions through to the development of the analytic tools needed to do this. I have collaborators that work in cancer, cardiology, neurology, organ transplant and infectious disease who perform experiments with a variety of state-of-the-art omics technologies.  
  
Current or prospective students can email me (ellis.patrick@sydney.edu.au) to find out more.
